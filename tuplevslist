Among Tuples and List — when to use which
Use a tuple when you know what information goes in the container that it is. For example, when you want to store a person’s credentials for your website.

person = (‘ABC’, ’admin’, ’12345')

But when you want to store similar elements, like in an array in C++, you should use a list.

groceries = [‘bread’, ’butter’, ’cheese’]
